Description
===========

FractalNow is an open source, multi-platform fractal
generator.
It provides users with tools to generate pictures of various types of fractals
quickly and easily.
It is made of both a command line (FractalNow) and a graphical tool
(QFractalNow).
The graphical tool, based on Qt library, allows users to explore fractals
intuitively and generate pictures.
Both tools are entirely multi-threaded and implement advanced algorithms and
heuristics that make computation very fast compared to most existing free
fractal generators.

Features
========

- Intuitive graphical user-interface (QFractalNow) to explore fractal space
  easily
- A command-line tool (FractalNow) that can work on machines without a
  desktop, and could be used by scripts to produce animations
- Several formulas available (Mandelbrot, Julia, Multibrot, Mandelbar,
  Burning ship, Rudy, and more...)
- Various types of coloring available (Iteration counts, Average coloring
  methods)
- Multiple anti-aliasing methods (Gaussian blur, Oversampling, Adaptive
  (intelligent)) to produce high quality images
- Advanced algorithms and heuristics to speed up computation (Solid
  guessing, Adaptive anti-aliasing, Caching)
- Entirely multi-threaded to work even faster on multi-core processors
- Ability to save/load configuration and gradient files
- Support for multiple precision (arbitrary precision) floats
