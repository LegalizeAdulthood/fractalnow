FractalNow is an open source, multi-platform fractal
generator.
It provides users with tools to generate pictures of various types of fractals
quickly and easily.
It is made of both a command line (FractalNow) and a graphical tool
(QFractalNow).
The graphical tool, based on Qt library, allows users to explore fractals
intuitively and generate pictures.
Both tools are entirely multi-threaded and implement advanced algorithms and
heuristics that make computation very fast compared to most existing free
fractal generators.
