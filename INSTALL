Installation
============

Requirements:
 * Qt 4.7.0 or newer
 * MPC 0.8 or newer 
 * MPFR 3.0.0 or newer (consistent with MPC)
 * GMP library (consistent with MPFR)

Note that Qt is only needed for the graphical tool, QFractalNow.

Linux
=====

You will need gcc to build the command-line tool (although any C99
compiler would do, just edit the CC variable in Makefile.configure files
from lib and command-line directories) and a modern C++ compiler
(preferably g++) to build the graphical tool.

The typical procedure for building and installing FractalNow is:
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
This will install FractalNow in /usr/local.

See configure help for more options:
$ ./configure -h

Windows
=======

The easiest way to build FractalNow for Windows is to use MSYS and
mingw.
Make sure MPC, MPFR, and GMP are correctly installed in your mingw
directory (most mingw builds do not include them, so you will
probably have to build them yourself).
Make sure MSYS is configured correctly to find your mingw 
installation (run /postinstall/pi.sh if it is not the case).
Under MSYS, add Qt binary directory to your path, and then type:
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
This will install FractalNow in ./install_dir.

The configure script will normally detect that you are running MSYS on
Windows and install (i.e. copy) the needed Qt DLLs (if Qt was not
compiled statically) as well.
You may have to add some other DLLs manually (e.g. pthread, gmp, 
mpfr, and mpc libraries if not linked statically).

See configure help for more options:
$ ./configure -h
