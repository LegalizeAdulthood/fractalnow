Installation
============

Requirements:
 * Qt 4.7.0 or newer

Note that while Qt is needed for the graphical tool (QFractalNow), the
command line tool (FractalNow) requires only a C library with pthread
support (it is pure ISO C99).

Linux
=====

You will need gcc to build the command-line tool (although any C99
compiler would do, just edit the CC variable in Makefile.configure files
from lib and command-line directories) and a modern C++ compiler
(preferably g++) to build the graphical tool.

The typical procedure for building and installing FractalNow is:
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
This will install FractalNow in /usr/local.

See configure help for more options:
$ ./configure -h

Windows
=======

The easiest way to build FractalNow for Windows is to use MSYS and
mingw.
Under MSYS, make sure Qt libraries and programs are in your path as well
as mingw binaries, and then type:
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
This will install FractalNow in ./install_dir.

The configure script will normally detect that you are running MSYS on
Windows and install the needed Qt DLLs (if Qt was not compiled
statically) as well.
You may need to add some other DLLs manually (e.g. pthread library if
dynamically linked).

See configure help for more options:
$ ./configure -h
