Gradient file syntax:

GRADIENT_FILE_FORMAT
BYTES_PER_COMPONENT
Pos1 Color1 ... PosN ColorN

Text characters can be upper-case or lower-case.
Arguments separators can be tabs, blank spaces, carriage return.

GRADIENT_FILE_FORMAT should be G073, which is the format described in this document.
Other format values (of older versions) may still be supported though.

BYTES_PER_COMPONENT specifies the number of bytes per component used for colors. It can be :
 - 1 for RGB8 (8 bits per component)
 - 2 for RGB16 (16 bits per component)

POSi : position of COLORi in gradient (between 0 and 1). First position must be 0, and last position must be 1. Positions must be strictly increasing.
COLORi : colors composing gradient.
Gradient must be made of at least 2 colors.

Colors must be specified as hexadecimal numbers. Red, green, and blue are respectively the 1st, 2nd and 3rd component.
Some RGB8 color examples :
- 0x0 for black
- 0xFF for blue
- 0xFF00 for green
- 0xFF0000 for red
- 0xFFFFFF for white
Some RGB16 color examples :
- 0x0 for black
- 0xFFFF for blue
- 0xFFFF0000 for green
- 0xFFFF00000000 for red
- 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF for white

In order for the gradient not to be discontinuous, the first and last color should be the same, for example 0x0 0xFFFFFF 0x0 for a black and white continuous gradient.

Acceptable floating numbers are for example :
2.567
4.146E-5
8.26e2
