To build installer, just copy fractalnow directory created
by "make install" here and compile NSIS script.

Note 1: If you are building an installer targetting win64
(x64) systems, you should first edit the script and define
PROGRAM_FILES constant as $PROGRAMFILES64 instead of
$PROGRAMFILES.

Note 2: Make sure all needed DLLs are present in fractalnow
directory before compiling the script (some DLLs may need
to be added manually to fractalnow directory after
"make install").
